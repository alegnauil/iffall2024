            Hello! My name is Angela and I am a junior from Shenzhen, China. I am taking this class because I want to learn more about front end development and I am also passionate about helping people through designing.

                Yes, I have a little experience with html, css, and js. I took CSE256 last year and used all three to complete projects. 
                <br> However, I still need to learn more about them and become more familiar and flexible with them (especially JS).

                Become more fluenet in manipulating the three languages to have them work together.

                Designing for screen would have different expectations for readability in terms of size, spacing, arrangements to best suit people's browsing habit, etc.

                It uses clear visual hierarchy, clean and uncluttered. I love the stylistic choices including the color scheme and the cohesive image styles. The animation is also fluid and responsive.

                Very minimalistic design, ensuring the focus remains on the content without overwhelming the viewer with unnecessary elements. 
                A side bar to navigate the content and provides a general idea of the article structure in quick glance.

                Has a lot of information and content but the pages don't feel cluttered. 
                Has well designed UIs for not only mobile or PC, but also VR, TV, and handheld. 
                Has personalized content and home page based on the user's browsing history and preferences. 
                Encourages user engagement and integrates community feedback.
