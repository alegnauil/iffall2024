        <p>
        What a world, the horizon's <br>
        Coming like a hell-bent killing machine <br>
        Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage <br>
        Burn it all again at a million degrees <br>
        Calling all the adamant upper-level <br>
        Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear <br>
        Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging <br>
        The enemy is here, I said stop
        </p>
        <p>
        Give it to three<br>
        I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean<br>
        One by one against, give me the name<br>
        All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game<br>
        You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you<br>
        I know you heard me, I fucking told you<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best <br>
        No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said<br>
        Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
        No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal<br>
        Children are afraid of the gods <br>
        Raise your hands and show me what's impossible <br>
        That makes us even, never tell me the odds<br>
        What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor<br>
        I don't wanna go to sleep<br>
        I need a breakdown quick in negotiations<br>
        Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop
        </p>
        <p>
        Give it to three<br>
        I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean<br>
        Drive-by violence, more of the same<br>
        I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed<br>
        Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?<br>
        I gotta know now, you better tell me<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best<br>
        No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said<br>
        Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
        I challenge you to all out life<br>
        We are gathered here today to get it right<br>
        Repeat after me<br>
        "I will not celebrate mediocrity<br>
        I will not worship empty shells<br>
        I will not listen to worthless noises<br>
        I will not subject myself to selected, predictable choices<br>
        My time, my attention<br>
        My quality should not be bought and sold<br>
        For convenience's sake, ever"
        </p>
        <p>
        We are not your kind<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
        We are not your kind<br>
